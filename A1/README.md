### A1: TopBid

  In this project it was requested to develop a web application for online auctions.
  We chose to design this application because, in a world where belongings are constantly being bought and sold, there is a need to simplify the process. In TopBid you can buy or sell an item with just a few clicks.
The application’s main feature is the bidding system, that updates constantly so that the client doesn’t miss the desired item. The client can also sell any item, creating an auction, where other users will bid, in order to buy it. The client with the biggest bid wins and gets the item. Another feature included is the “Buy Now” option, where the seller puts a price he thinks is fair for the item to be sold and the buyer can buy it instantaneously, without waiting for the auction period to end. The buyer can also search for auctions on a certain item being, and will find a list with all the auctions, of that item, that are going on.
  The user’s profile is a very simple profile where others can see the user’s name, address and photo. The users may also exchange messages using the application’s messenger, in order to arrange meetings to exchange items. Administrators have the authority to block and erase auctions and also block accounts.

### Revision History
### Item 1:

  There will be 2 kinds of users: costumers/owners and visitors.
  The costumers/owners are registered users that have a simple profile with a photo, name, email and address. Other users will be able to see this information but only the user may update it. These users can bid on items and sell his own items, being able to update information of the item.
  The visitors are unregistered users that can watch auctions and log in or sign in. This type of users doesn’t own a profile and can ́t see other users information.
  There are also the administrators who own special profiles with the same information as normal users but with special permissions, like ban a auction or a user when reported and delete comments.
