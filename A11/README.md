## 1. Product presentation

### Briefing of the Product

We developed an online auctions platform, where the visitors can see the auctions and all the last bid done. The visitors can also search for specific products, search by category and also by the auction's owner name. The users can make bids and if they want to buy the product imediately they can use the button "Buy Now" and buy for the highest price set by the owner. The users can like and unlike coments and auctions, they can also report auctions by clicking on an auction and clicking on the "Report" button, under the auction's image. They can also report other users simply by clicking on the report button in each user's comment or by clicking on Report on the owner's page. The administrator can ban and unban auctions and users.
As a user you can add auctions to the wish list, edit your profile, see the auctions created by you and the bids you've made. You can also contact the owner by clicking on the owner's name and then fill the form, sending an e-mail to the owner, or using the telephone number, which is available on the owner's profile page. 
Users may login using the google login and recover the password.
